# EEG Movement Intent Research

Welcome to the **EEG Movement Intent Research** repository. This project is part of a research initiative at Columbia University's Biomedical Engineering lab, [Robotics And Rehabilitation (RoAR)](https://roar.me.columbia.edu/).

## Overview

This public repository contains:

- A comprehensive [wiki](https://github.com/EngrIbrahimAdnan/EEG-Movement-Intent-Research/wiki/EEG-Movement-Intent-Research-%7C-Home) detailing the research methodology, data collection process, and preliminary observations.
- A submodule pointing to a private repository titled `EEG_analysis`. The private repository contains Python scripts for data setup, preprocessing, and model training, as well as EEG data from multiple subjects.

## Research Objective

Our primary objective is to decode neurophysiological recordings across test subjects into accurate movement intent. By analyzing EEG data, we aim to understand and interpret a user's intention to perform specific movements, such as lifting an arm or moving a cursor on a screen.

## Key Components

### Wiki

The [wiki](https://github.com/EngrIbrahimAdnan/EEG-Movement-Intent-Research/wiki/EEG-Movement-Intent-Research-%7C-Home) includes detailed information on:

- **Research Background**: Introduction to EEG and its applications in movement intent decoding.
- **Data Collection**: Methodology for collecting EEG data from participants.
- **Preprocessing**: Techniques used for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Overview of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model used for classification.
- **Preliminary Observations**: Insights and findings from initial experiments.

### Private Repository: `EEG_analysis`

The `EEG_analysis` repository contains:

- **Python Scripts**: For setting up the environment, preprocessing data, and training the CNN model.
- **EEG Data**: Collected from multiple subjects, stored in BrainVision format.

Please note that access to the private repository is restricted. If you are interested in collaborating or accessing the data and scripts, please contact us.

## Getting Started

To clone this repository along with the submodule, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/EEG-Movement-Intent-Research.git
```
